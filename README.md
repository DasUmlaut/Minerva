# Minerva
a Javascript image blending library.

Here's the deal. I designed this to batch-produce textures for my Minecraft mod. It uses HTML canvas to blend images. You'll have to use a preloader to be able to do much with it (Minerva has one included). If anyone really wants to start using this and needs documentation, I'll gladly right some.

## To do
I need to add RGB <-> HSI conversion formulas. Every one that I've tried turned out disastrous.
